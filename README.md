# CS52 Preprocessors Workshop (Coffeescript & Flow)

Hi everyone!  Welcome to the CS52 workshop on preprocessors, with a focus on *CoffeeScript* and *Flow*.  Here, you will learn the basics of using both by...

:rocket: Creating AND debugging a simple game of Tic-Tac-Toe!  

(Debugging might make you :running: right now, follow this workshop and you will be :metal:)

# What are preprocessors?

Preprocessors are programs that takes in data and outputs it into a form that can be read by another, more common program.  In this case, there are many preprocessors for JavaScript that make the language more efficient and less buggy.  

*CoffeeScript* is JavaScript but :punch: better :punch: - or at least, it's supposed to be!  It is:

- Faster and more efficient - comparing a CoffeeScript file to the JavaScript it outputs, the former saves 33% to 50% of characters to be typed.
- Seamlessly connects to any existing JavaScript library.
- Compiles one to one to the equivalent JS
- Results in less errors (e.g. variables are auto-scoped, so you won't be overwriting global variables by omitting `var`)
